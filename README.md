# Askbot
Askbot is an API connected to a MongoDB database that you can ask questions to, built in Node.js. The goal of this application was to familiarize myself more with Node.js.

## Installation
Use npm install to install all the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
In the terminal type ```nodemon index ``` and navigate in the browser to localhost:5000
Ask a question by typing in your name and selecting a question.
Askbot will look up the answer that is connected to your question in the database.
You can contribute questions and answers in the 'post to the cloud' section.
